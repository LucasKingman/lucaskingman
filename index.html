    <div class="text"><h2>Welcome!</h2><p>Hello! I’m Lucas Kingman!</p><p>I’m a hobbyist musician, artist, and graphic designer who enjoys being creative! I also have some coding experience too! (This website was made by me and is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages!</a>) I hope to bring joy and more art into the world with my creations and work!</p><p>This website acts as my main hub on the internet and as a personal portfolio! Here you will be able to find what I have made, information relating me, where else I’m at on the internet, and much more! </p></div>

    <div class="text"><h2>What Have I've Made!</h2><p>I’ve made a lot of things in my time however I usually make and post music! (At least for now!) If you want to take a look at what I've made, you can go to the <a href="creations.html">Creations Page</a> on this site! It’ll show the main things I’ve worked on that’s public!</p><p>I also make art occasionally, but I don’t post it. I want to focus on learning the fundamentals first! Although it’s something I plan on making more of and possibly even post in the future!</p></div>

    <div class="image"><img class="futureImage" width="833" height="483" src="assets/temp_future.png"></div>
    <div class="text"><h2>The Future?</h2><p>For the future, I plan to continue to make music! I have a few songs, some album Ideas, experiments, and other things I want to do. But for now making music is simply a hobby I enjoy doing and I want to keep it like that for a while. Due to this I can’t guarantee that these projects will get done! (At least not in a timely manner!)</p><p>Regardless, I do want to keep creating music (and possibly other things), that I enjoy! It’s a important part of me and I don’t plan to stop creating anytime soon!</p></div>
